============

Pythonistas can rest easy knowing that H2O provides support for this popular programming language. You can also use H2O with IPython notebooks.

Getting started with Python
---------------------------

The following sections will help you begin using Python for H2O.

Installing H2O with Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find instructions for using H2O with Python in the `Downloading and installing H2O <../downloading.html#install-in-python>`__ section and on the `Downloads page <http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/latest_stable.html>`__.

From the Downloads page:

1. Click the Install in Python tab.
2. Follow the on-page instructions.

Python documentation

See our `Python-specific documentation <https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-py/docs/index.html>`__.

Grid search in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See a notebook demonstration for how to use grid search in Python.

Anaconda Cloud users
--------------------

You can run H2O in an Anaconda Cloud environment. Conda 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6 repositories are supported (as are a number of H2O versions). See Anaconda's `official H2O package <https://anaconda.org/h2oai/h2o/files>`__ to view a list of all available H2O versions. You can refer to the `Install on Anaconda Cloud <../downloading.html#install-on-anaconda-cloud>`__ section for information about installing H2O in an Anaconda Cloud.
